## Deep Learning Models

### Kinematics problem
This is a classification problem, with the objective to detect if there is any movement.  I worked on the data (pre-processing it) and applied a [MLP](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/DeepLearning/blob/dd7aa78b4e55efeb12317de2b981e82cc01fbcfa/Kinematics%20(Binary%20Classification)/pytorch-classification-mlp.ipynb).
