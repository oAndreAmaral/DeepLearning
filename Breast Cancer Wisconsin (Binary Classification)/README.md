### Breast Cancer Wisconsin problem
This is a classification problem, since the dataset contains both continuous and categorical features I applied the [tabular method](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/DeepLearning/blob/12d96d89300c4103051fd621ec6b8057d20d9c5d/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Binary%20Classification)/Pytorch%20ANN%20TabularModle.ipynb) using Pytorch.  In a different approach I worked on the data (pre-processing it) and applied a [MLP](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/DeepLearning/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Binary%20Classification)/Pytorch%20Cancer%20Classification%20(All%20Data).ipynb).
